# LandingPage_OdinProject
I practice how to make a design template for a web page following The Odin Project curriculum. 
In my HTML file I learned how to link a css file file as well as linking different font-styles from google.
In my CSS file I was able to practice the formatting of a webpage by creating different flex containers. As well as how to manipulate flex containers and its contents to display and style. As well as styling and creating buttons.
